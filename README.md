# Installation guide:
1. Put all files in your project.
2. Run 'npm install' by cmd in main directory with "server.exe" excutable script.
3. Server using MySQL as a database. So you have to import sql file in to your database. In database management make one like "ragerp".
   Import sql structure file into it ( link here https://rage.mp/forums/topic/1559-open-source-role-play-server/ )
4. Rename the /packages/RP/sMisc_default.js to sMisc.js then edit the way to connect to your database.

THEN ENJOY.
